# Project Name
This website was originally developed to be the personal portfolio for Yuma Michelus, 4/29/2018

## Discription
This site is a single page portfolio site with four sections, home, about, portfolio, and contact me.
It was made primarily with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, but it does use a bit of php for the contact form.

## Installation
1) Download HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP code along with all accompanying images/files.
2) The code in index.php will have to be transferred to a .html file to open it locally.
3) Once the HTML code has been open make sure that all the pathways to the external files/images are correct.
4) Done :)

## Bugs
No known bugs
